<p>
  The pale Usher&mdash;threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see
  him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
  handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
  known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it
  somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

  "While you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what name
  a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue leaving out, through
  ignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh the signification of
  the word, you deliver that which is not true." &mdash;<i>Hackluyt</i>

  "WHALE.... Sw. and Dan. <i>hval</i>. This animal is named from roundness or
  rolling; for in Dan. <i>hvalt</i> is arched or vaulted." &mdash;<i>Webster's
  Dictionary</i>

<p>
  "WHALE.... It is more immediately from the Dut. and Ger. <i>Wallen</i>; A.S.
  <i>Walw-ian</i>, to roll, to wallow." &mdash;<i>Richardson's Dictionary</i>

  Call me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
  little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
  shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
  the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
  circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
  it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
  involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
  of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
  upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
  from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
  people's hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
  as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
  flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
  There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
  in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
  towards the ocean with me.

  "Kant pointed out in the middle of last century, what had not previously been discovered by mathematicians or physical astronomers, that the frictional resistance against tidal currents on the earth's surface must cause a diminution of the earth's rotational speed. This immense discovery in Natural Philosophy seems to have attracted little attention—indeed to have passed quite unnoticed—among mathematicians, and astronomers, and naturalists, until about 1840, when the doctrine of energy began to be taken to heart."

  There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
  as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.
  Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
  the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
  breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
  crowds of water-gazers there.
